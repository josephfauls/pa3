# What is a Soundboard
As described above a soundboard performs two key functions. 1. It should organize various related audio clips in a logical manner, and 2. it should provide a convenient mechanism for the user to play the aforementioned audio clips. My system performs the first function by grouping the related sounds (more specifically the buttons that play them) into separate rows of an HTML table (technically each row of the larger table contains a table whose rows are composed of the buttons). It also utilizes a search bar with which you can search for specific audio clips by name. My system performs the second function by providing buttons which triggers the playing of a specific audio file. By combining the visual elements of text and buttons with the ability to press them and have an audio clip play soundboards exemplify seamless integration of multimedia elements.
